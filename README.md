Find pi
=======

A Matlab program using Geometric Probability Model to find the approximately value of pi.

Repuirements:
=================

1. use "rand" function
2. don't use loop
2. input is a array of numbers of experiments
3. output is a array of approximately values of pi for every experiment.

Problem:
==================

"rand" function cannot generate a array from a input array

Solution:
====================

use "rand" to create a 3D matrix. one experiment is in one dimention. Use "reshape" function to rebuild the array from 2D to 3D or from 3D to 2D
